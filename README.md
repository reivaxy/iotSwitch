# iotSwitch

This is the first slave module for the iotinator project, its purpose is to allow commuting a relay through the iotinator framework.

It's intended to be a simple stub to create more complex slave modules.

You'll need to clone these repositories into your arduino "libraries" directory to be able to compile:

- https://github.com/reivaxy/XOLEDDisplay.git 
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XIOTDisplay.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XIOTConfig.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XEEPROMConfig.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XUtils.git
- https://github.com/reivaxy/XIOTModule.git


And some libraries that can be found through the Arduino IDE

TODO: list the libraries :)
