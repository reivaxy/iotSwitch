# iotSwitch

This is the first agent module for the iotinator project, its purpose is to allow commuting a relay through the Xiot framework, in order to turn on and off a lamp, a heater, an air conditionner or any other device.

To use it, you'll preferrably also need the iotinator master module (https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator), or you can just use it's REST API to integrate to your own designs.

Although it's functionnal, it's also intended to be a simple stub to create more complex agent modules, which is why it offers a simple feature, and won't be expanded or enriched with more features, like programmable scheduling for instance (this will be available in just another Xiot module)

You will find <a href="https://github.com/reivaxy/iotinator/wiki/110.-Dev-environnement-and-debug">here</a> all the information to install your dev environment.

Modules common API is described here (WIP): https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reivaxy/iotinator/master/resources/prototype/finished.jpg

Here is an iotSwitch module encased in a power socket to remote control it:
